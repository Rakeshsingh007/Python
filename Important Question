difference bw python 2 and 3 and which version you are using
how python script runs
range vs xrange
Python memory management
Namespaces and Scope
max = 5<4 and 5 or 4 
max = 5 if 5<4 else 4
args and kwargs
__name__ variable
byte object and str object
Inplace operator     a = a+b and it will return a+b and store it in a also
enumerate,zip,iteritem,items,sorted,reversed
list set and dictionary comprehension 
x = [x for x in range(4)] #list comprehension
print(x)

x = {x for x in range(4)} #set comprehension
print(x)

x = {x:x for x in range(4)} #Dictionary comprehension
print(x)

x = (x for x in range(4)) #generator comprehension

iterator
generator
yield keyword
lambda filter map reduce
OOPS concepts
Static and class variable
class ,static and static methods
Partial ffunction
first class function
Decorator
deepcopy and shallow copy
slicing concept
List basic function like pop del remove insert append sort reverse sorted reversed



.pyc file
datatypes
operation applied on number dataypes.
precedence order of execution
diffrence between input and raw_input
input returned string type
String can be concatenate like this => "adb" "rty"
Exceptions in Python
typeerror,value err,index erri
a['a']-> type err,indices must be int not strng
how can be acheive method overloading
packing unpacking of arguments
pallindrome
string reverse
factorial recursion
prime no
fabonacci
swapping
diff between append extend.
opertator applied over list +,*, in, not in
Remove duplicates from list
why tuple is faster than list
dict insertion order is not preserved
Dict key can be any immutable obj
Frozen set
collection => orderedDict=>  it preserve inserion order
Diffrence between modules and packages
how to find current working directory
how to get list of directory
mkdir command
rename file
exception handling
combination we can use in exception
read,readline,readlines
fflush
with open
self
class object structure
constructor
destructor 
new, init, magic fun
decorators
class variable, function variable, instance variable
Instance cannot modify the class level vriable

oops property
polymorphism,inheritance,abstraction, encapsulation
if we want to make anything static we have to make it class variable

Types of method class, static, instance


Decorators
abstract class

end parameter in print function
enumerate

destructor in python
lambda filter map reduce

diffrence bw normal and lambda fun

operator overloading in python->magic method
shallow copy deep copy
python memory management
