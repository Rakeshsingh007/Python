difference bw python 2 and 3 and which version you are using
range vs xrange
input vs raw_input
how python script runs and .pyc file
precedence order of execution
Python memory management
Namespaces and Scope
basic datatypes

Property | Data Structure					      List	  Tuple	  Dict	  Set

Mutable										              Yes		  No		  Yes		  Yes
Ordered										              Yes		  Yes		  No		  No
Sortable									              Yes		  Yes		  No		  No
Reversible									            Yes		  Yes		  No		  No
Slice-able [ : ]							          Yes		  Yes		  No		  No
Comprehensions								          Yes		  No		  Yes		  Yes
Accessible using index operators [ ]		Yes		  Yes		  No	    No
Merging using + operator					      Yes		  Yes		  No		  No

byte object and str object
slicing concepts
String can be concatenate like this => "adb" "rty"
List basic function like pop del remove insert append sort reverse sorted reversed extend +,*, in, not in
difference between append and extend
why tuple is faster than list
max = 5<4 and 5 or 4  # turnery operator 
max = 5 if 5<4 else 4 # turnery operator 
swapping = a,b = b,a
enumerate,zip,iteritem,items,sorted,reversed,join,split
args and kwargs and packing unpacking of arguments
Difference between == and is operator in Python
in , not in , is , is not identity operator
__name__ variable
Inplace operator     a = a+b and it will return a+b and store it in a also

list set and dictionary comprehension 
x = [x for x in range(4)] #list comprehension
print(x)

x = {x for x in range(4)} #set comprehension
print(x)

x = {x:x for x in range(4)} #Dictionary comprehension
print(x)

x = (x for x in range(4)) #generator comprehension

iterator
generator
yield keyword
lambda filter map reduce
OOPS concepts polymorphism,inheritance,abstraction, encapsulation
Static and class variable
class ,static and static methods
method overloading
operator overloading using magic method
class object structure
constructor
destructor 
issubclass and super
@property setter getter deleter
new, init, magic fun
Instance can modify the class level variable refer coreyscahfer
abstract class
Partial function
first class function
Decorator
deepcopy and shallow copy
Exceptions in Python and custom exception
typeerror,value error ,index error 
dict insertion order is not preserved ---> NO
collection => orderedDict=>  it preserve inserion order
Dict key can be any immutable object -----> YES
set and Frozen set
Diffrence between modules and packages
Python OS Module
how to find current working directory   ---> os.getcwd()
how to get list of directory ---> os.listdir()
mkdir command  ---> os.mkdir() 
rename file  ---> os.rename('old.txt','New.txt')
python sys module 
File Handling read,readline,readlines seek tail fflush with open write
